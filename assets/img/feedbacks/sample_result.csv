If you saw a video and lose it... It's lost forever unfortunately like so many other apps. Starting not to see much diverse videos like when I first joined the app. That was the one thing that was enjoyable compared to other platforms. Another Con: when going back to look at saved videos that you may not have had time to see originally has a lot of deleted content. That I do not like"", ""Great platform. Amazing algorithm and great user data protection. Easy to use and configure. Very few ads, and the ones I do see are relevant. I use TT to learn about all sorts of things...home repairs, exercises, health tips. And of course it's entertaining in other ways without being irritating or one dimensional. The mix of posts is just right, and I like that I can consume vids without creating them"", ""Great for growth and meeting people as well as posting lots of different kinds of content but the reporting system is BS. I've had posts taken down for responding to hateful people but people get away with fatphobia, sexism, racism, homophobia and nudity. The help center needs major improvement. Otherwise I'm given mostly content I enjoy. I've put not interested on several AI art posts yet I still seem them all the time which is another flaw I heavily dislike.""]"

I've been trying to get it back by redownloading the app multiple times but it didn't work. I tried changing settings still nothing. I have no problems other than that.

Please fix this."", ""Its pretty nice and fun, but since today morning, a lot of people including me are complaining about the photo slide feature either suddenly disappearing or when you post a video using it, it doesn't get any views and sometimes doesn't work.
